  ## About
  
  Cylon.js is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js.

  It provides a simple, yet powerful way to create solutions that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices at the same time.

  Want to use Ruby on robots? Check out our sister project Artoo [(http://artoo.io)](http://artoo.io).

  Want to use the Go programming language to power your robots? Check out our sister project Gobot [(http://gobot.io)](http://gobot.io).

  ## Meet The Code

  Cylon.jsâ€™s makes commanding robots incredibly simple and fun.

  All you need to get started is the `cylon` module:

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon

  Then install modules for whatever hardware support you want to use from your robot. For the example below, an Arduino using the Firmata protocol:

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon-firmata

%h2 Examples
%p The example below connects to an Arduino, and every second turns the LED either on, or off.
:markdown
  The example requires that the Arduino has the Firmata sketch installed, and that it is connected on the port `/dev/ttyACM0`. You need to install Firmata on your Arduino, and to change the `port` parameter to match the port that your system is actually using.
%p Make sure to upload the "Standard Firmata" sketch or an equivalent Firmata sketch to your Arduino first. Without that code running on the Arduino, Firmata can't communicate with Cylon. You can find the example sketch in your Arduino software under "Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata".
%h3 JavaScript:
:markdown
      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require("cylon");

      // Initialize the robot
      var robot = Cylon.robot({
        // Change the port to the correct port for your Arduino.
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
        device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13 },

        work: function(my) {
          // we do our thing here
          every((1).second(), function() { my.led.toggle(); });
        }
      });

      // start working
      robot.start();
%h3 CoffeeScript:
:markdown
      :::javascript
      Cylon = require "cylon"

      # Initialize the robot
      robot = Cylon.robot
        connection:
          name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

        device:
          name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13

        work: (my) ->
          # we do our thing here
          every 1.second(), -> my.led.toggle()

      robot.start()
  
  Note: before running any examples in the `examples/` dir from source, make sure to compile using `grunt coffee` first.
