  ## About
  
  Cylon.js is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using node.js.

  It provides a simple, yet powerful way to create solutions that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices at the same time.

  Want to use Ruby on robots? Check out our sister project Artoo [(http://artoo.io)](http://artoo.io).

  ## Meet The Code
  Cylon.jsâ€™s simple code makes telling robots what to do incredibly simple and fun.

  All you need to get started is the `cylon` module

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon

   Then hook it up to your robot (in this case, a [Sphero](http://gosphero.com)):

      :::javascript
      connection:
        name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0'

      device:
        name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'

  And tell it what to do!

      :::javascript
      work: function(my) {
        every((1).second(), function() { 
          my.sphero.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
        });
      }
