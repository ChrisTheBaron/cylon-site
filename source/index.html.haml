  ## About
  
  Cylon.js is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js.

  It provides a simple, yet powerful way to create solutions that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices at the same time.

  Want to use Ruby on robots? Check out our sister project Artoo [(http://artoo.io)](http://artoo.io).

  Want to use the Go programming language to power your robots? Check out our sister project Gobot [(http://gobot.io)](http://gobot.io).

  ## Meet The Code

  Cylon.jsâ€™s makes commanding robots incredibly simple and fun.

  All you need to get started is the `cylon` module:

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon

  ... and whichever `cylon` module is needed for your specific hardware (in this case, a [Sphero](http://gosphero.com)):

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon-sphero

  Now write your robot code. Require Cylon.js, and create a robot:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

      // Initialize the robot
      var robot = Cylon.robot({

  Then tell the robot code about your hardware to hook it up:

      :::javascript
        connection: {name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0'},

        device: {name: 'ball', driver: 'sphero'},

  And tell it what work to do. This code tells the Sphero that every second, it should roll around in a random direction:

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {
          every((1).second(), function() { 
            my.ball.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
          });
        }
      });

  Last, tell the robot to start. That's it!

      :::javascript
      
      robot.start();
