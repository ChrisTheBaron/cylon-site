  ## About
  
  Cylon.js is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js.

  It provides a simple, yet powerful way to create solutions that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices at the same time.

  Want to use Ruby on robots? Check out our sister project Artoo [(http://artoo.io)](http://artoo.io).

  ## Meet The Code

  Cylon.jsâ€™s makes commanding robots incredibly simple and fun.

  All you need to get started is the `cylon` module:

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon

  ... and whichever `cylon` module is needed for your specific hardware (in this case, a [Sphero](http://gosphero.com)):

      :::javascript
      npm install cylon-sphero

  Then hook it up to your robot:

      :::javascript
      connection:
        name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0'

      device:
        name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'

  And tell it what to do!

      :::javascript
      work: function(my) {
        every((1).second(), function() { 
          my.sphero.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
        });
      }

%h2 Hardware Support
%p
  Cylon.js has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following robotics and physical computing platforms are currently supported:
  %ul
    %li
      = link_to "Arduino", "http://www.arduino.cc/" 
      &lt;==&gt;
      = link_to "Cylon.js For Firmata Adaptor", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-firmata"
    %li
      = link_to "Ardrone", "http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" 
      &lt;==&gt;
      = link_to "Cylon.js for ARDrone Adaptor/Drivers", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-ardrone"
    %li
      = link_to "Sphero", "http://www.gosphero.com/" 
      &lt;==&gt;
      = link_to "Cylon.js For Sphero Adaptor/Driver", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-sphero"
%p Support for common shared device drivers, is provded using the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) module:
%ul
  %li
    = link_to "GPIO", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output" 
    &lt;==&gt;
    = link_to "Cylon.js For GPIO Drivers", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-gpio"  
%p More platforms and drivers are coming soon...
