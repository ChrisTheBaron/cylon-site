      The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful.
      With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the ability to use the familiar Arduino IDE, the Digispark is a great way to jump into electronics, or perfect for when an Arduino is too big or too much.

    ## Drivers

    Cylon.JS' communication with the Digispark relies on using the Littlewire protocol.
    This allows for interaction with a wide range of I/O hardware devices and interfaces, using a set of previously-defined and easy-to-use drivers.

    Available drivers for the Digispark platform are listed below.
