    ## How to Install

    To get started, just install the NPM module:

        $ npm install cylon-firmata

    ## How to Use

    This quick example blinks an LED connected to an Arduino once per second:

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connections: {
            arduino: { adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' }
          },

          devices: {
            led: { driver: 'led', pin: 13 }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            every((1).second(), my.led.toggle);
          }
        }).start();

    ## How to Connect

    ### Upload the Firmata Firmware to the Arduino

    This section assumes you're using an Arduino Uno or another compatible board, and a UNIX operating system (OS X or Linux). If you already have the Firmata sketch installed, you can skip straight to the examples.

    ### OS X

    First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.
    A dialog box will appear telling you that a new network interface has been detected.
    Click "Network Preferences...", and when it opens, simply click "Apply".

    Install the cylon-firmata module:

        $ npm install cylon-firmata

    Once plugged in, use [Gort](http://gort.io)'s `gort scan serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

        $ gort scan serial

    Use the `gort firmata install` command to install `avrdude`, this will allow you to upload firmata to the arduino:

        $ gort firmata install

    Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran `gort scan serial`:

        $ gort firmata upload /dev/tty.usbmodem1421

    Now you are ready to connect and communicate with the Arduino using serial port connection

    ### Ubuntu

    First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.

    Install the cylon-firmata module:

        $ npm install cylon-firmata

    Once plugged in, use [Gort](http://gort.io)'s `gort scan serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

        $ gort scan serial

    Use the `gort firmata install` command to install `avrdude`, this will allow you to upload firmata to the arduino:

        $ gort firmata install

    Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran `gort scan serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `ttyACM0`:

        $ gort firmata upload ttyACM0

    Now you are ready to connect and communicate with the Arduino using serial port connection
