    ## How to Install

    Install the module via NPM:

        $ npm install cylon cylon-speech

    After the module is installed, but before you run any scripts using it, ensure the `espeak` utility is installed on your computer.

    There are packages available for Linux, OS X, and Windows.

    ### Linux

    On most Linux distros, there should already be a package you can install.
    If you use Aptitude Package Manager (apt-get), just install it with:

        $ sudo apt-get install espeak

    This is also true for Single-Board Linux Computers like the Raspberry-Pi and the Beaglebone Black.

    Once the package has finished installing, try this command to verify everything is working as expected:

        $ espeak "This is awesome, Linux speaking"

    If you hear your computer talking to you, everything is working as expected.
    If not, please refer to the [espeak docs](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/commands.html) for more help.

    ### OS X

    Install espeak through Homebrew.

        $ brew install espeak

    After installing, test it out:

        $ espeak "This is awesome, OS X speaking"

    ### On Windows

    For Windows systems there is a `.exe` file you can download from [SourceForge](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html).

    Same as with the above operating systems, make sure it works as advertized when the instalation has completed.

        $ espeak "This is awesome, Windows OS speaking!"

    ## How to Use

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          // voice for espeak can be specified either in one string or as params for the adaptor.
          // both connections below will reproduce with the same voice.
          // connections: { speech: { adaptor: 'speech', language: 'en, gender: 'f', 'voice: '3' } },
          connections: {
            speech: { adaptor: 'speech', voice: 'en-f3', speed: 130 }
          },

          devices: {
            mouth: { driver: 'speech' }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            my.mouth.say("This is awesome!");
            my.mouth.say("I'm a Cylon.JS robot, and I'm talking!");
          }
        }).start();
