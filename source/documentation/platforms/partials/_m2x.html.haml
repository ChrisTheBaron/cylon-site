    ## How to Install

    Install the module with:

        $ npm install cylon-m2x

    ## How to Use

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require("cylon");

        Cylon.robot({
          connections: {
            m2x: { adaptor: "m2x", masterKey: "<masterKey>" }
          },

          devices: {
            m2x: { driver: "m2x" }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            my.m2x.streamValues("<deviceId>", "temp", {}, function(err, data) {
              console.log("Err: ", err);
              console.log("Values: ", data);
            });
          }
        }).start();

    ## How to Connect

    On the [M2X site][M2X], sign up for an account, or log into your existing account.
    After doing so, create a new Device.
    The name of the device and details don't matter that much, but they should be meaningful.

    With that done, inside the new Device, create a new Stream.
    This will be the data repository you can push and read values from Cylon.

    Once that's done, you're good to go.
    Make sure to grab the Master API key from your account details page and Device ID from the
    devices page.

    Now you're ready to hook up Cylon to M2X!
