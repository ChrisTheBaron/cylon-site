    ## How to Install

    Installing cylon.js with ardrone support is pretty easy.

        npm install cylon-ardrone

    ## How to Use

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connections: {
            ardrone: { adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1' }
          },

          devices: {
            drone: { driver: 'ardrone' }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            my.drone.takeoff();
            after((10).seconds(), function() {
              my.drone.land();
            });
            after((15).seconds(), function() {
              my.drone.stop();
            });
          }
        }).start();

    ## How to Connect

    The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.
