    %p The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and popular ARM based single board computer with digital & PWM GPIO, and i2c interfaces built in.

    %h2 How to install
    
    %p
      Installing cylon.js with raspberri-pi support is pretty easy.
    :markdown
          :::bash
          npm install cylon-raspi

    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program causes an LED to blink.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          coming soon ..
    

    %h2 How to connect
    %h3 Connecting to Raspberry Pi GPIO
    %p
      This module only works on a real Raspberry Pi. Do not bother trying on any other kind of
      computer it will not work. Also note you will need to connect actual circuits to the Raspberry Pi's
      GPIO pins.

    %h3 Enabling the Raspberry Pi i2c on raspbian
    %p You must add these two entries in your /etc/modules

    :markdown
          :::bash
          i2c-bcm2708
          i2c-dev

    %p You must also ensure that these entries are commented in your /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

    :markdown
          :::bash
          #blacklist spi-bcm2708
          #blacklist i2c-bcm2708

    %p Now restart your raspberry pi.

    %h3 Enabling PWM output on GPIO pins.

    %p
      You need to install and have pi-blaster running in the raspberry-pi, you can follow
      the instructions for pi-blaster install on our repo here:
