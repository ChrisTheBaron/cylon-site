    %p Tessel runs JavaScriptâ€”no server necessary. Just like web or mobile development, use your own IDE and libraries to program physical applications.

    :markdown 
      Tessel supports packages from `npm` to leverage the growing Node.js community and capabilities. That's HTTP, Twitter, web server, color, and async support right out of the box. Uploading new code is as easy as `tessel push`!

    -#%h2 How to connect
