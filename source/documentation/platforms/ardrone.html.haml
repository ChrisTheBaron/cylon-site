    %p
      The ARDrone from Parrot is an inexpensive quadcopter that is controlled using WiFi. It includes a built-in front-facing HD video camera, as well as a second lower resolution bottom facing video camera.

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to install
    %p
      Installing artoo with ardrone support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
    :markdown
          :::bash
          gem install artoo-ardrone

    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program lets the ARDrone take-off, hover, and land.

    :markdown
          :::ruby

          require 'artoo'

          connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone, :port => '192.168.0.43:5556'
          device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

          work do
            drone.start
            drone.take_off

            after(25.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
            after(30.seconds) { drone.stop }
          end
    %h2 How to connect
    %p
      The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a
      connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones,
      you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.

    %h2 Automatic Reset From Emergency Mode

    %p
      When you first connect to the ARDrone by calling the `start` method, if it is in "emergency" mode, the ARDrone will not take off. Artoo can automatically reset it back "normal" mode, to be able to fly IF you pass in the navigation like this example:

    :markdown
          :::ruby

          connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone
          device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

          connection :navigation, :adaptor => :ardrone_navigation
          device :nav, :driver => :ardrone_navigation, :connection => :navigation

          work do
            on drone, :ready => :fly
            drone.start(nav) # pass the nav object into the start method
          end

          def fly(*data)
            drone.take_off
            after(15.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
            after(20.seconds) { drone.stop }
          end
  %section.drivers
    %h2 Drivers
    %p
      Available drivers for the ARDrone platform are listed below. There are three drivers for the ARDrone: the ARDrone for flight control, the ARDroneNav for navigation data, and the ARDroneVideo for grabbing video data.
