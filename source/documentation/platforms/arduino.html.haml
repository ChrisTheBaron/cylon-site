  %p Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

  %h2 How to install
  %p Installing Cylon.js with Arduino support is pretty easy.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        npm install cylon-firmata
  %h2 How to use
  %p This small program lets you push a button on the arduino board to turn a LED on or off. In less than 10 lines of code using Cylon.js.
  %h3 Javascript
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
          devices: [{name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13},
                   {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2}],

          work: function(my) {
            my.button.on('push', function() {my.led.toggle()});
          }
        }).start();

  %h3 CoffeeScript
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        Cylon = require('cylon')

        Cylon.robot
          connection:
            name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

          devices:
            [
              {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13},
              {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2}
            ]

          work: (my) ->
            my.button.on 'push', -> my.led.toggle()

          .start()

  %h2 How to connect
  %h3 OSX

  %p The main steps are:
  %ul
    %li Install the cylon-firmata npm module
    %li Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
    %li Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
    %li Connect to the device using Cylon

  %p
    First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.
    A dialog box will appear telling you that a new network interface has been detected.
    Click "Network Preferences...", and when it opens, simply click "Apply".

  %p Install the cylon-firmata module:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ npm install cylon-firmata

  %p Once plugged in, use the `cylon scan serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon scan serial

  %p
    Use the `cylon firmata install` command to install avrdude,
    this will allow you to upload firmata to the arduino:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon firmata install

  %p
    Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to
    the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran
    `cylon scan serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `/dev/ttyACM0`:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon firmata upload /dev/ttyACM0

  %p Now you are ready to connect and communicate with the Arduino using serial port connection

  %h3 Ubuntu

  %p The main steps are:
  %ul
    %li Install the cylon-firmata npm module
    %li Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
    %li Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
    %li Connect to the device using Cylon

  %p First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.

  %p Install the cylon-firmata module:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ npm install cylon-firmata

  %p Once plugged in, use the `cylon scan serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon scan serial

  %p
    Use the `cylon firmata install` command to install avrdude,
    this will allow you to upload firmata to the arduino:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon firmata install

  %p
    Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to
    the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran
    `cylon scan serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `ttyACM0`:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon firmata upload ttyACM0

  %p Now you are ready to connect and communicate with the Arduino using serial port connection

  %h3 Windows

  %p We are currently working on docs and instructions for Windows. Please check back soon!

  %p Coming soon.

%section.drivers
  %h2 Drivers
  %p
    Thanks to
    %b cylon.js
    and
    %b node.js
    it is possible to interact with several I/O hardware devices and interfaces connected to the arduino
    using a set of already defined and easy to use drivers, all of this thanks to the cylon.js architecture, in conjuction with the cylon-firmata
    adaptor (using the firmata communication protocol),
    which makes it even possible to swap the entire platform for something else like digispark, and keep using the same code you just wrote for
    arduino, this just by swapping a couple of lines in your program.
  %p Available drivers for the arduino platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kind physical computing (using cylon.js and node.js) you could be doing:

  .hardware
    %h2 GPIO Drivers
    .devices
      // TODO: Update drivers list at the top of the page.
      = partial "documentation/partials/devices_gpio_drivers"
    %h2 i2c Drivers
    .devices
      = partial "documentation/partials/devices_i2c_drivers"
