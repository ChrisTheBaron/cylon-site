  %p
    Allows user to receive in-flight navgation data from an ARDrone. Navigation data includes such information as the ARDrone's current pitch and yaw, along with many other data elements.

  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  %p
    Communication with the ARDrone's navigation data interface takes place using a WiFi connection. The ARDrone is a WiFi access point, so it normally can be the only device you connect to, without some additional effort to reconfigure the drone itself to put it into infrastructure mode.

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon')

        Cylon.robot({
          connection: {name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'},

          devices:
            [{name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'},
            {name: 'nav', driver: 'ardroneNav'}]

            name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'

          devices:
            [
              {name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'},

            ]

  %h2 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Once the connection and the devices have been setup (as explained above) you can receive navigation events on them as follows:

        Cylon.robot({

          devices:
            [{name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone'},
            {name: 'nav', driver: 'ardroneNav'}],

          work: function(my) {
            my.drone.config('general:navdata_demo', 'TRUE');

            my.nav.on('update', function(data) {
              Logger.info(data);
            }
          }
        }).start();

          devices:

              {name: 'nav', driver: 'ardroneNav'}
            ]

          work: (my) ->
            my.drone.config 'general:navdata_demo', 'TRUE'

            my.nav.on 'update', (data) ->
              Logger.info data

        .start()
