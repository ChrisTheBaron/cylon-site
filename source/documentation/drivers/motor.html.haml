      Provides motor manipulation tools for artoo like on/off, speed modulation using PWM,
      use of bidirectional motors using forward/backward pins.

  %section.how-to
    %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
    %h3 For Arduino:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          Cylon = require('cylon')

          Cylon.robot
            connection:
              name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

            device:
              name: 'motor', driver: 'motor', pin: 3

  %section.public-methods
    %h2 Commands:
    
    %dl.methods 
      %dt turnOn
      %dd Starts the motor.
      %dt turnOff
      %dd Stops the motor.
      %dt toggle
      %dd Sets the state of the motor to the oposite of the current state, if motor is on then sets it to off.
      %dt speed(speed_value)
      %dd Sets the speed of the motor to the value provided in the speed param, speed value must be an integer between 0 and 255.
      %dt currentSpeed
      %dd Returns the current speed of the motor as an integer between 0 and 255.

    %h2 Events

    %dl.methods 
      %dt start
      %dd Sent when the device has been started and is ready to use.
