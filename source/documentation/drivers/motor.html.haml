      Provides motor manipulation tools for artoo like on/off, speed modulation using PWM,
      use of bidirectional motors using forward/backward pins.

    %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
    %h3 For Arduino:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          Cylon = require('..')

          Cylon.robot
            connection:
              name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

            device:
              name: 'motor', driver: 'motor', pin: 3

  %section.public-methods
    %h2 Commands:

    %h3 turnOn
    %p Starts the motor.
    
    %h3 turnOff
    %p Stops the motor.
    
    %h3 toggle
    %p Sets the state of the motor to the oposite of the current state, if motor is on then sets it to off.

    %h3 speed(speed_value)
    %p ets the speed of the motor to the value provided in the speed param, speed value must be an integer between 0 and 255.

    %h3 currentSpeed
    %p Returns the current speed of the motor as an integer between 0 and 255.

    %h2 Events
    %ul 
      %li
        %h3 start
        %p Sent when the device has been started and is ready to use.
