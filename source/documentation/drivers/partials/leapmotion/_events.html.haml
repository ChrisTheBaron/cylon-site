  # Events

  ## frame

  Gets triggered on every frame the Leap sends. Passes the related frame for use
  in event handlers.

  For an example of a frame JS object, please see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stewart/24981316929dcfd8480a).

  ## hand

  Gets triggered on every hand the Leap detects. Passes the related hand for use
  in event handlers.

  For an example of a hand JS object, please see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stewart/bc5b4fe7736617965d0c).

  ## gesture

  Gets triggered when the Leap picks up gestures. Passes the related gesture for
  use in event handlers.

  For an example of a gesture JS object, please see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stewart/ed49d2cac9a63a75e09c).

  # What's new with V2 Tracking

  V2 tracking allows for more robust hand models, so that full information about the hand can be inferred despite occlusion. The position and rotation basis for every joint is both consistent and accessible.

  ## Pinch

  Pinch indicates whether one finger is touching another, on a scale of zero to one.

  `hand.pinchStrength`

  ## Grab

  Grab indicates how close a hand is to being a fist â€“ any fingers that aren't curled will reduce grab strength.

  `hand. grabStrength`

  ## Data Confidence

  Know when it is hard for the Leap to see a hand. When near the edge of the screen or when one hand is occluding another, confidence will drop from one to zero.

  `hand.confidence`

  ## Left or Right

  The tracking labels hands as left or right, which is useful in a variety of interaction models.

  `hand.type`

  ## Finger Type

  The new tracking model always provides hands with five fingers composed of bone-segments.

  `hand.thumb, hand.indexFinger, etc..`

  ## Bone Positions.

  The positions and rotations of each finger bone are provided by the Bone API.

  Get the bones:
  `finger.metacarpal`
  `finger.proximal`
  `finger.medial`
  `finger.distal`

  Get the joint positions:
  `bone.prevJoint`
  `bone.nextJoint`
