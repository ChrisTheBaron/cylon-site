    %p
      Provides tools to use maxbotix sonar (range finder).

    %h2 How to stablish a connection and setup the driver
    %h3 For Arduino:

  %section.public-methods
    %h2 Commands:

    %h3 range → distance_in_inches(float)
    %p
      Returns the distance measured by the sonar in inches.

    %h3 range_cm → distance_in_cm(float)
    %p
      Returns the distance measured by the sonar in cm.

  %section.public-events
    %h2 Events:
    %p
      The events will be triggered when the amount of time specified by the param :interval, when setting up the driver, passes.
    %h3 :range
    %p
      Gets triggered after :interval amount of time passes, everytime the range will be read and the event triggered.

    %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
    %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
