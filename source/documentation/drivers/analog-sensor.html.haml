    %p
      Makes it possible to interact with analog inputs on your device and obtain values that represent the analog input send by the sensors.
      The value received from an analog input read from the sensor goes from 0 to 1027.

    %h2 Circuit and Schematic
    %p
      Circuit for analog sensors is pretty much the same as the button circuit, you just need to substitute
      the button for a photoresistor.

      It should look like the circuit in this example.
