    %p
      Allows user to receive in-flight video data from an ARDrone. Video data from the ARDrone is returned from either the front-facing, or the bottom-facing cameras.

    %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
    %p
      Communication with the ARDrone's video interface takes place using a WiFi connection. The ARDrone is a WiFi access point, so it normally can be the only device you connect to, without some additional effort to reconfigure the drone itself to put it into infrastructure mode.
