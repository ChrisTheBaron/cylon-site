    ## How To Use

    What follows is an example of button and joystick input for the DualShock 3.

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connections: {
            joystick: { adaptor: 'joystick' }
          },

          devices: {
            controller: { driver: 'xbox-360' }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            ["a", "b", "x", "y"].forEach(function(button) {
              my.controller.on(button + ":press", function() {
                console.log("Button " + button + " pressed.");
              });

              my.controller.on(button + ":release", function() {
                console.log("Button " + button + " released.");
              });
            });

            my.controller.on("left_x:move", function(pos) {
              console.log("Left Stick - X:", pos);
            });

            my.controller.on("left_y:move", function(pos) {
              console.log("Left Stick - Y:", pos);
            });

            my.controller.on("right_x:move", function(pos) {
              console.log("Right Stick - X:", pos);
            });

            my.controller.on("right_y:move", function(pos) {
              console.log("Right Stick - Y:", pos);
            });

            my.controller.on("lt:move", function(pos) {
              console.log("Left Trigger: ", pos);
            });

            my.controller.on("rt:move", function(pos) {
              console.log("Right Trigger: ", pos);
            });
