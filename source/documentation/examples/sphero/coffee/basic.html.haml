  # Sphero

  For this Cylon example, we're going to politely ask a Sphero to roll in a random
  direction, and to change it's direction every second. Before we get started,
  make sure you've got the `cylon-sphero` module installed.

  First, let's import Cylon:

      :::ruby
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  With that done, we can now start defining our robot:

      :::ruby
      Cylon.robot

  We'll be using one connection and one device, both the Sphero.

      :::ruby
        connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' }
        device: { name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero' }

  The work for this robot is pretty straight-forward. Every second, we're going to
  tell the Sphero to roll at speed `60`, in a random direction.

      :::ruby
        work: (me) ->
          every 1.second(), ->
            me.sphero.roll 60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360)

  Simple enough. And with that done, we can now tell the robot to start working:

      :::ruby
      .start()
