  # Sphero Color

  This Cylon example will connect to a Sphero, and change it's color randomly
  every second. Before we start, ensure you've got the `cylon-sphero` module
  installed.

  To get started, let's import the Cylon module:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require '../..'

  Now we can start defining our robot.

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  Our robot will have, as with other Sphero examples, one connection and one
  device, both to the same Sphero.

      :::coffeescript
        connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' }
        device: { name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero' }

  The work our robot will be performing is fairly, straightforward, it will just
  be changing it's color to a random new color every second.

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          every 1.second(), ->
            my.sphero.setRGB Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000)

  And with the pieces in place, we can start our robot!

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
