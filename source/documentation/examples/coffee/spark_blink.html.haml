  # Spark - Blink

  For this example, we're going to connect to a Spark Core and make the LED on
  pin D7 blink on a 1-second interval. Before we start, make sure you've got the
  `cylon-spark` module installed.

  First, let's make sure to load the Cylon module:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  After we've got that done, we can start defining our robot:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  We'll have a singular connection to a Spark Core, using the
  previously-mentioned `cylon-spark` module. We'll also have one device, the LED
  on pin D7.

      :::coffeescript
        connection:
          name: 'spark', adaptor: 'spark', deviceId: '', accessToken: ''

        device:
          name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D7'

  Those are all the components for our robot, so next we'll define the work. All
  we're going to do for this example is tell the LED to toggle every second.

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          every 1.second(), -> my.led.toggle()

  And with all those pieces in place, we can tell the robot to get started:

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
