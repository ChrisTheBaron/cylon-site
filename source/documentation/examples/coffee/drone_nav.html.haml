  # Drone Navigation

  For this Cylon example, we'll be using an ARDrone again, this time getting data
  from it's navigation board. When the board emits an 'update' event, we'll log
  the data it's collected to the console.

  Before we get started, make sure you've got the `cylon-ardrone` module
  installed. First, let's start by loading up Cylon:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  After we've got that loaded up, let's start defining our robot.

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  Our robot will, as with the basic ARDrone example, have a connection to an
  ARDrone over an IP address, and a `drone` device to control the drone itself.
  Except this time, we're also adding a `nav` device that will bind to the
  ARDrone's navigation board.

      :::coffeescript
        connection:
          name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1'

        devices: [
          { name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone' },
          { name: 'nav', driver: 'ardroneNav' }
        ]

  For our robot's work, it's going to enable the nav board's demo mode in the
  drone's config, and log data to the console whenever the nav board emits the
  'update' event.

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          my.drone.config 'general:navdata_demo', 'TRUE'
          my.nav.on 'update', (data) -> console.log data

  Simple enough. Now all that's left is to start the robot:

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
