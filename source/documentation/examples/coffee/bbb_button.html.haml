  # Beaglebone Button

  First, let's import Cylon:		

      :::ruby
  		Cylon = require('cylon')

  Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

      :::ruby
  		# Initialize the robot
  		Cylon.robot

  Let's define the connections and devices:

      :::ruby
  		  connection:
  		    name: 'beaglebone', adaptor: 'beaglebone'

  		  devices:
  		    [
  		      {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'P9_12'},
  		      {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 'P9_14'}
  		    ]

  Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
  tell it what work we want to do:

      :::ruby
  		  work: (my) ->
  		    my.button.on 'push', () -> my.led.toggle()

  Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
  hardware with, we can start it:

      :::ruby
  		.start()
