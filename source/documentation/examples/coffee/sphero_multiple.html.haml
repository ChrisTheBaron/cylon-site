  # Multiple Spheros

  Let's do an example of Cylon controlling multiple Spheros at the same time. The
  Spheros will both randomly roll around and change their colors every second.

  Before we run this example, make sure to have `cylon-sphero` installed (`npm
  install cylon-sphero`)

  First, load up Cylon. Since we're in the Cylon repo, we can use the version
  already here:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  Since both of our Spheros are going to have faily similar behaviour, we can
  define a class to hold their attributes:

      :::coffeescript
      class SpheroRobot

  We'll define the Sphero's connection sans port, which we'll add later.

      :::coffeescript
        connection:
          name: 'Sphero', adaptor: 'sphero'

  Both Spheros have the same device configuration

      :::coffeescript
        device:
          name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero'

  Now we can define the work for the Spheros. Every second, they'll print their
  name, change to a random color, and roll in a random direction.

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          every 1.seconds(), ->
            console.log my.name
            my.sphero.setRandomColor()
            my.sphero.roll 60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360)

  Next up, let's define what's different about our bots so we can tell them apart
  later on. We'll give them each a different name, and define their connection
  ports.

      :::coffeescript
      bots = [
        { name: "Thelma", port: "/dev/rfcomm0" },
        { name: "Louise", port: "/dev/rfcomm1" }
      ]

  Now that the pieces are in place, we can start making our robots.

      :::coffeescript
      for bot in bots

  We'll make a new instance of `SpheroRobot`, and modify it.

      :::coffeescript
        robot = new SpheroRobot

  Now we'll tell the robot what it's name is, and what it's connection port should
  be:

      :::coffeescript
        robot.name = bot.name
        robot.connection.port = bot.port

  Now our robot's ready, and we can add it to Cylon's collection of robots.

      :::coffeescript
        Cylon.robot robot

  And now that our robots have all been set up, we can start them all at once:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.start()
