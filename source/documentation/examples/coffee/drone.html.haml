  # Drone

  For a very simple drone demo, we're going to use Cylon to make an ARDrone take
  off, hover, and land. Before you get started, make sure you have the
  `cylon-ardrone` module installed.

  First, we need to load up Cylon.

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  And now that we have that taken care of, we can define our robot.

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  Our robot will communicate with an ARDrone over an IP address, and controls the
  drone using a device we're going to call "drone":

      :::coffeescript
        connection: { name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1' }
        device: { name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone' }

  The work for this robot is pretty straightforward. It's going to take off, and
  then land after ten seconds. Five seconds later, after it's safely on the
  ground, it will fully stop.

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          my.drone.takeoff()
          after 10.seconds(), -> my.drone.land()
          after 15.seconds(), -> my.drone.stop()

  Simple as can be. And now that we've got all that set up, we can get started!

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
