  # Crazyflie

  For this Cylon demo, we're going to connect to a Crazyflie, and then make it
  take off and land. Before we get started, make sure you've got the
  `cylon-crazyflie` adaptor installed.

  To start us off, let's import Cylon:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require '../..'

  Now that we've got that set up, we can start defining our robot:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  We'll be using one connection and one device for this robot, both using the
  crazyflie adaptor. We'll be connecting to the Crazyflie using the CrazyRadio.

      :::coffeescript
        connection:
          name: 'crazyflie', adaptor: 'crazyflie', port: "radio://1/10/250KPS"

        device:
          name: 'drone', driver: 'crazyflie'

  With the parts in place, we can start defining our robot's work.

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->

  When our drone is ready, we'll make it takeoff. After ten seconds, we'll tell it
  to land, and five seconds after that to stop.

      :::coffeescript
          my.drone.on 'start', ->
            my.drone.takeoff()
            after 10.seconds(), -> my.drone.land()
            after 15.seconds(), -> my.drone.stop()

  With all that done, we can start up the robot and get the Crazyflie flying:

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
