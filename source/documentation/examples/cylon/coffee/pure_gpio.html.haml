  # Pure GPIO

  Here we'll demonstrate an example of controlling a digital pin using a pure GPIO
  interface.

  First, we need to require the `digital-pin` class inside of Cylon:

      :::ruby
      require 'cylon/dist/digital-pin'

  Then we'll instantiate a new instance of it, with write permissions and using
  pin 4.

      :::ruby
      pin4 = new Cylon.IO.DigitalPin(pin: 4, mode: 'w')

  Once the pin's been opened, we'll write to the console to indicate so:

      :::ruby
      pin4.on 'open', (data) ->
        console.log "Pin files have been created"

  And on the 'digitalWrite' event for the pin, we'll log the value that's been
  written:

      :::ruby
      pin4.on 'digitalWrite', (value) ->
        console.log "Value written to pin: \#{value}"

  When the pin's been connected, we'll set it to high (1)

      :::ruby
      pin4.on 'connect', (data) ->
        console.log "Pin mode has been setup!"
        pin4.setHigh()

  And with all our events defined, we'll connect the pin:

      :::ruby
      pin4.connect()
