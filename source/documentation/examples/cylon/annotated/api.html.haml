  # API

  In this Cylon example, we'll be demonstrating the HTTP API that Cylon spins up
  when it starts.

  This example involves two Spheros, so before you start make sure you have the
  `cylon-sphero` module installed.

  First, let's import Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Next up, we'll configure the API Cylon will serve, telling it to serve on port
  `8080`.

      :::javascript
      Cylon.api({
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: '8080'
      });

  Since we're making two very similar robots (Spheros, in this case), let's put
  the different parts of each robot in objects so we can initialize them later.
  The only differences between the bots are their names and the port they'll be
  using.

      :::javascript
      var bots = {
        'Thelma': '/dev/rfcomm0',
        'Louise': '/dev/rfcomm1'
      };

  Now we can define the basic robot both of our Sphero robots will be based on.

      :::javascript
      Object.keys(bots).forEach(function(name) {
        var port = bots[name];

        Cylon.robot({
          name: name,

  Both robots will be connecting to Spheros, and so using the cylon-sphero
  adaptor:

      :::javascript
          connections: {
            sphero: { adaptor: 'sphero', port: port }
          },

  And both will be connecting to the same kind of device (you guessed it,
  a Sphero).

      :::javascript
          devices: {
            sphero: { driver: 'sphero' }
          },

  Both robots will be performing the same kind of work as well.  Every second,
  they'll print their name to the console, set themselves to a random color, and
  roll in a random direction.

      :::javascript
          work: function(my) {
            every((1).seconds(), function() {
              console.log(my.name);
              my.sphero.setRandomColor();
              my.sphero.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
            });
          }
      });

  And now that Cylon has all the robots we're intending to give it, let's get
  started!

      :::javascript
      Cylon.start();

  Now Cylon will start up the robots and their devices, as well as an API server
  listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`.
