  # Blink

  For this very basic Cylon example, we're just going to hook up to an Arduino and
  blink an LED on it with a one-second interval.

  To get started, let's load up Cylon:

      :::ruby
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  With Cylon loaded, we can now define our basic robot.

      :::ruby
      Cylon.robot

  Our robot has one connection, to an Arduino using the `cylon-firmata` adaptor:

      :::ruby
        connection: { name: "arduino", adaptor: "firmata", port: "/dev/ttyACM0" }

  Our robot also only has one device (or at least only one we're concerned about),
  an LED on pin 13.

      :::ruby
        device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13 }

  Next, we'll define the robot's work, which will be toggling the LED every
  second:

      :::ruby
        work: (my) ->
          every 1.second(), -> my.led.toggle()

  And that's all the parts of our robot. All that's left is to start it.

      :::ruby
      .start()
