  # Analog Sensor

  A quick example of using an Arduino's analog sensor with Cylon. The program will
  log to the console when the sensor has hit it's upper and lower limits.

  Before you run this program, make sure you have the `cylon-firmata` module
  installed.

  First, let's load up Cylon:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require '../..'

  Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  Let's define the connection to our Arduino:

      :::coffeescript
        connection:
          name: "arduino"
          adaptor: "firmata"
          port: "/dev/ttyACM0"

  Now we can define the analog sensor we're going to use, along with it's upper
  and lower limits:

      :::coffeescript
        device:
          name: 'sensor'
          driver: 'analogSensor'
          pin: 0
          upperLimit: 900
          lowerLimit: 100

  Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
  tell it what work we want to do:

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          my.sensor.on 'upperLimit', (val) ->
            Logger.info "Upper limit reached: #{val}"

          my.sensor.on 'lowerLimit', (val) ->
            Logger.info "Lower limit reached: #{val}"

  Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
  hardware with, we can start it:

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
