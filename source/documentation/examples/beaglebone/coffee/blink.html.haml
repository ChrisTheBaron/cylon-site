  # Beaglebone Blink

  First, let's import Cylon:

      :::ruby
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

      :::ruby
      # Initialize the robot
      Cylon.robot

  Let's define the connections and devices:

      :::ruby
        connection:
          name: 'beaglebone', adaptor: 'beaglebone'

        device:
          name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'P9_12'

  Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
  tell it what work we want to do:

      :::ruby
        work: (my) ->
          # we do our thing here
          every 1.second(), -> my.led.toggle()

  Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
  hardware with, we can start it:

      :::ruby
      .start()
