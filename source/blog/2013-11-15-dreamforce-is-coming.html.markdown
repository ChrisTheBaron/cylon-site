We're really excited because next week is <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF13/" target="blank">Dreamforce</a>, and Team Cylon will be there in "full force" as it were! We have a workspace in the Developer Zone at the <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/10/every-internet-of-things-thing-at-dreamforce-2013.html" target="blank">Connected Device Lab</a> on the second floor of Moscone West, and we're also <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/apex/ActivityList#a093000000XfGjrAAF" target="blank">leading a workshop</a> on the opening day of the conference. Both will include lots of <a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero</a> fun thanks to our friends at Orbotix. We will have a bunch of great giveaways too! 

But don't be fooled, we're talking serious business, even if it comes in a rolling package. We will show you how easily you can use Cylon.js and Force.com together to integrate all kinds of devices that provide real-time business information. Cylon.js unleashes the power of JavaScript and <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a> to help build the Internet of Things, and we will be using Spheros in a fun way, to teach developers how they can start making use of these new technologies.

At our workshop, as well as over the course of the conference, we will show people how to use Cylon.js and Force.com together to integrate devices, using the Sphero 2.0 as our "minimum viable robot". Dreamforce is one of the largest technology conferences on Earth, and we are very honored and excited to be a part of it. If you are attending the conference, <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/apex/ActivityList#a093000000XfGjrAAF" target="blank">the session page is here</a>. See you in San Francisco!
