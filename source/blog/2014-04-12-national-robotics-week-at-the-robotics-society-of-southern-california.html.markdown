Wrapping up our [National Robotics Week](http://nationalroboticsweek.org) robot road show, we brought Cylon.js ([http://cylonjs.com](http://cylonjs.com)) back to SoCal to speak to the [Robotics Society of Southern California](http://www.rssc.org/). The venerable organization was established in 1989, and we were honored to be able to bring our JavaScript powered robots into the halls of academia.

The RSSC holds its meetings at the [CSULB](http://www.csulb.edu/) campus, which has a really great facility. We had just flown back from Boston where we'd introduced our new ["10 Rules Of Robot Ops"](http://robotops.com) site earlier this week. We used this as the theme for the talk. We had finished support for the [Neurosky Mindwave Mobile EEG](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile) the previous week, and it was cool to incorporate Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) into our demos. We also showed Cylon.js running on one of the [Tessel](http://tessel.io) prototype boards, the new JavaScript-powered microcontroller. And of course, we had to show our ever popular version of Conway's Game of Life using [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com) robots.

Thanks to the Robotics Society of Southern California for inviting us to speak to their prestigious group, we had a great time sharing our latest work!
