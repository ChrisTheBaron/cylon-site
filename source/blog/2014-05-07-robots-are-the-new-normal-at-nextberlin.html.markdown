Our next stop on the robot world tour was NextBerlin 2014. Taking place as part of the massive [Web Week Berlin](), this conference connected business people from startups and large companies, media, and technologists from all over Europe.

Team Cylon.js had a special place to demo our JavaScript robots, and we spoke to many people while demoing a Leap Motion connection to a Sphero. Everyone wanted to play with it, and we were happy to spark a sense of fun and wonder to the business oriented crowd. Of course, it also happed to showcase the power of the platform too!

Over the 2 days of the conference, we met many people, gave a few interviews, and learned a lot about the European technology scene.

Thank you very much to the conference organizers for inviting us to Berlin!
