We had just enough time to recharge a few batteries from [MakerFaire 2014](http://makerfaire.com), when we packed up Team Cylon.js and headed to [JSConf 2014](http://2014.jsconf.us/) in sunny Florida. JSConf is one of the centers of innovation (and fun!) in the JavaScript world. 

Thanks to organizer [Chris Williams](https://twitter.com/voodootikigod) and the ongoing efforts of the [Nodebots](http://nodebots.io/) team, there is already a well-established tradition of hardware hacking that has been going on. This means lots of cool people ready to take a look at what Cylon.js can offer to the community.

When we arrived for the makerspace setup day, we were astonished to find out that the amazing new [NodeRockets](http://www.noderockets.com/) project had already been built entirely on top of Cylon.js, from the ground controller, to the launcher, to the capsule. Amazing! More on this incredibly cool project in a future post.

We gave our talk on Cylon.js the next morning, where we demoed [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), [Tessel](https://tessel.io/), [Beaglebone Black](http://beagleboard.org/), [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/), [ARDrone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [Digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1) & [Neurosky](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-1). That was a lot to pack in!

The activity day was the day after our talk, and attendees were able to build either Nodebots, Nodeboats, Nodecopter, or Noderockets. There were people milling around everything having a great time hacking on their preferred typo of robotic device. We know of several teams that used Cylon.js, for example the Nodecopter team that placed second approached us with great excitment, telling us of their experience.

Thank you very much to the JSConf organizers and staff for having us be a part of the fun. We appreciate it, and look forward to next year.
