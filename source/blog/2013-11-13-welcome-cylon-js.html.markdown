Welcome to the next era of open source robotics! This blog is where we will discuss new and interesting developments on Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com" target="blank">http://cylonjs.com</a>) the new JavaScript robotics framework based on <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a>, as well as anything else interesting to the robot community at large.

We first introduced Cylon.js to the world at the <a href="http://js.la/" target="blank">Los Angeles JavaScript</a> meetup last month, held appropriately at <a href="http://www.idealab.com/" target="blank">Idealab</a> in Pasadena, CA. Yes, the same Pasadena where the legendary <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/index.php" target="blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</a> controls NASA robots currently on Mars. It was a great chance to share our work with the local community, and we were really excited and grateful for the wonderful response.

Since then, our team has been working hard on the project, adding more hardware support, and we have so much more coming. We're really excited about where the Cylon.js project is going, and how we can use the power of JavaScript and Node.js for open source robotics. Please give Cylon.js a try, and help us make it the easiest, most flexible, and most powerful framework in JavaScript for robotics and physical computing.
