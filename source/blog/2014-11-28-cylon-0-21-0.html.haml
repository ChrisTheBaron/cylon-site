  Just in time for [RobotsConf][], we've released Cylon 0.21.0!

  This release focuses on stability and simplifying some long-standing architecture concerns.

  As always, you can check out the [compare view][] on GitHub.

  ## Updates For Application Developers

  - **New `connections/devices` syntax:** - we've updated the syntax for how multiple devices or connections are specified in Cylon.js.
    This new object-based syntax makes it more straightforward to specify many connections or devices.
    The existing array syntax, as well as the single-object `device/connection` syntax, is deprecated, and will be removed in 1.0.0.
    Here's a comparison of the two:

        :::javascript
        // previous syntax, now deprecated:
        Cylon.robot({
          connections: [
            { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
            { name: 'leap', adaptor: 'leapmotion' }
          ],

          devices: [
            { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13, connection: 'arduino' },
            { name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 9, connection: 'arduino' }
          ]
        });

        // new object-based syntax:
        Cylon.robot({
          connections: {
            arduino: { adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
            leap:    { adaptor: 'leapmotion' }
          },

          devices: {
            led:    { driver: 'led',    pin: 13, connection: 'arduino' },
            button: { driver: 'button', pin: 9,  connection: 'arduino' }
          }
        });

  - **Fluent syntax updates** - we've updated our fluent JS syntax a bit, adding `#device` and `#connection` methods to help make it easier to set up robots.
    Here's a comparison:

        :::javascript
        // declarative syntax:
        Cylon.robot({
          connections: {
            arduino: { adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' }
          },

          devices: {
            led: { driver: 'led', pin: 13 }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            every((1).second(), my.led.toggle);
          }
        }).start();

        // fluent syntax
        Cylon
          .robot()
          .connection('arduino', { adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' })
          .device('led', { driver: 'led', pin: 13 })
          .on('ready', function(bot) {
            setInterval(bot.led.toggle, 1000);
          });

        Cylon.start();

  ## Updates For Platform Developers

  - **No more Connection/Device class:** - Cylon's internal 'Connection' and 'Device' classes are no more.
    Now, when a user adds a Connection or Device to their robot, they're getting a direct instance of an Adaptor/Driver.
    For the most part, this shouldn't result in issues, but if you're doing manual method proxying you may have issues.
    These are the requisite changes to sub-modules:

    - in Adaptor subclasses, instead of referencing `this.connection`, just reference `this`.
    - in Driver subclasses, instead of referencing `this.device`, just reference `this`.
    - in Driver subclasses, `this.connection` is now an Adaptor instance, not a Connection instance.

  ## Ollie Up at RobotsConf!

  Every Cylon.js release adds some new hardware support, and this time we've added [cylon-ollie] with early support for the new [Ollie] robot from our friends at Orbotix. We're bringing some to [RobotsConf] for people to play with.

  Look for our "preview" blog post about RobotsConf coming next week...
