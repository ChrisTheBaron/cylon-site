We said farewell to Germany after [NextBerlin 2014](http://nextberlin.eu/), then headed off to that learned city Edinburgh, Scotland for [Scotland.js](http://scotlandjs.com/). Taking place in the remarkable museum [Dynamic Earth](http://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/), the conference featured excellent speakers, and a very interactive format with a question track taking place immediately after each of the talks.

During both days of the conference, we met friends both old and new. Talking to each other was a crucial element for the conference format, and we really enjoyed all the great conversations.

Our talk was fast-paced, since we have a lot of hardware. Luckily we've gotten it down to a highly choreographed level, so we were able to demo [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), [Tessel](https://tessel.io/), [Beaglebone Black](http://beagleboard.org/), [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/), [ARDrone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), and [Neurosky](http://neurosky.com/) all in one talk!

Thank you so much to the conference organizers for inviting us to take part!
