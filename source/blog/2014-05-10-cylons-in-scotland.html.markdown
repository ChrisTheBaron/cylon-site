We said farewell to Germany after [NextBerlin 2014](http://nextberlin.eu/), then headed off to that learned city Edinburgh, Scotland for [Scotland.js](http://scotlandjs.com/). Taking place in the remarkable museum [Dynamic Earth](http://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/), the conference featured excellent speakers, and a very interactive format with a question track taking place immediately after each of the talks.

During both days of the conference, we met friends both old and new. Talking to each other was a crucial element for the conference format, and we really enjoyed all the great conversations.

Thank you so much to the conference organizers for inviting us to take part!
