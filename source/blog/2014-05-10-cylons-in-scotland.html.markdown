We said farewell to Germany after [NextBerlin 2014](), then headed off to that learned city Edinburgh, Scotland for [Scotland.js](). Taking place in the remarkable museum [Dynamic Earth](), the conference featured excellent speakers, and a very interactive format with a question track taking place immediately after each of the talks.

During both days of the conference, we met friends both old and new. Talking to each other was a crucial element for the conference format, and we really enjoyed all the great conversations.

Thank you so much to the conference organizers for inviting us to take part!
