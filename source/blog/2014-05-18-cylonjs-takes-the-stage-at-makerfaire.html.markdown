After our wonderful experiences in Scotland, we flew a long haul all the way to San Franciso airport heading to [MakerFaire 2014]()! Hailed as the "greatest show and tell on Earth", we were greatly excited and honored to speak about Cylon.js on the Make:Electronics stage.

Thank you very much to the conference organizers for letting us take the stage and do our thing at such an illustrious event. We've hit the big time now!
