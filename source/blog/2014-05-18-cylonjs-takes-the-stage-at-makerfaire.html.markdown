After our wonderful experiences at [Scotland.js](http://scotlandjs.com/) and a cameo at the [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/), we flew a long haul all the way to San Franciso airport heading to [MakerFaire 2014](http://makerfaire.com)! Hailed as the "greatest show and tell on Earth", we were greatly excited and honored to speak about [Cylon.js on the Make:Electronics stage](http://makerfaire.com/makers/cylon-js-the-javascript-evolution-of-open-source-robotics/).

It was incredibly exciting to speak at MakerFaire's 9th year, after having attended it so many times. The crowd was really energetic, and we were ready for our close-up after having been on the road. 

We even were able to have family meet up with us to go around and enjoy the rest of the experience. Here is the youngest member of our crew getting ready to go on.

Thank you very much to the MakerFaire organizers for letting us take the stage and do our thing at such an illustrious event. We've hit the big time now!
