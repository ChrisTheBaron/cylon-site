Team Cylon.js was at the Intel Developer Forum last week, and we got our hands on the new Intel Edison boards for the first time. We might have been a little skeptical after the hype of the initial Edison annoucement at CES, but once we started working with it, within 24 hours we were very excited about the possibilities.

Some info about how Edison works.

Something about cylon-intel-iot

perhaps a tiny video showing it actually works?
