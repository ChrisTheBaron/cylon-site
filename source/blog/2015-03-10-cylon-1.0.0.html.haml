  It's been a long time coming, but version 1.0.0 of Cylon.js is finally here!

  We're thrilled to share this with all of you.

  This release signifies we think the primary user-facing APIs in Cylon are stable, and we don't anticipate any more breaking changes in the near future.

  As with always, you can check out the [compare view][] on GitHub.
